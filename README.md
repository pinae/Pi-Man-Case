# Pi-Man-Case
A case for a Raspberry-powered game console.

This design is based on a 180mm acrylic sphere (175mm inner diameter). Print `lower_frame.stl` and `upper_closing.stl` to fill the mouth. Note that `lower_frame.stl` needs support material to print correctly. Two `fixing_block.stl` are needed to stabilize the construction after the mouth part is cut out of the sphere. `ring180.stl` is a stand for the finished sphere.

The lower frame has housings for 4 M3 nuts to attach the Raspberry Pi. Insert them before gluing the frame into the shere because they are hard to reach after that. If you are using short screws tighten them once before gluing the lower frame so the nuts slide the whole way into the housing.

To assemble the case you need glue that bonds acrylic and ABS (or PLA if you printed that). I used Pattex and super glue. The easiest way for the assembly is to combine the upper and lower parts of the mouth with some tape and apply the glue in one go. Put everything inside of the sphere and close it while carefully adjusting the position. You can add the fixing_blocks after the mouth is fixed. Cut away the part of the shere that occludes the mouth and sand the corners. Do not forget to add holes in the side for the HDMI and the power cable.
